A computer file is a resource for storing information, which is available to a computer program and is usually based on some kind of durable storage. 
A file is "durable" in the sense that it remains available for other programs to use after the program that created it has finished executing. 
Computer files can be considered as the information technology counterpart of paper documents which traditionally are kept in office and library files, and this is the source of the term.
